## Classes

**Data Structures & Algorithms** - CS 2110

The Study, design, implementation and analysis of a number of data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, AVL trees, heaps, hash tables, maps, sets, and graphs. Algorithms on data structures include a variety of searching, sorting and graph algorithms.

**Software Development** - CS 2132

This course introduces programming and software development techniques in a procedural language. In particular, the C programming language and the UNIX operating system will be used to teach program design paradigms, source code management, software testing, debugging, scripting, and other techniques useful for software development.

**Web Development** - CS 1170

The introduction of key web concepts and skills for designing, implementing, and maintaining web content. Topics include UI and UX best practices, hypertext markup languages such as HTML, style sheets, client side programming, multimedia foundations, dynamic content and web content organization and maintenance.

**Systems Programming** - CS 2122

Presents tools, techniques, and concepts for systems programming. Students will be exposed to assembly and will be introduced to the C programming language. The course also discusses memory hierarchies, performance measurement, exception control flow, and performance related issues.

**Software Engineering** - CS 3130

The course examines the process of software development, from initial planning through implementation and maintenance. A brief survey of available tools and techniques will be presented covering the topics of analysis, planning, estimating, project management, design, testing, and evaluation. Particular emphasis will be given to organizing and planning, team participation and management, top-down design and structure charts, system and information flow diagrams,
walk-throughs and peer review, and testing and quality control.


# Featured - **ViceRight**

An app designed around the intake and control of certain known vices.

 Users can use the app as a journal to record personal intake amounts & times for better health management. They can see their usage on a daily, weekly, and
 monthly scale, and are notified when certain drugs are incompatible to take with one another, or when an unsafe amount of a drug is consumed.
